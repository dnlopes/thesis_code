Experimental Setup:

1- General Test: Latency/Troughtput

3 plots: 1 replica, 3 replicas e 5 replicas

Em cada plot:

7 execuções (pontos)

Cada ponto com diferentes numero de users:
1,3,5,15,30,45,60




TEST 1 - Measure custom JDBC overhead:

How? 
1- run TPCC with default driver in 1 replica with multiple users
2- run TPCC with custom driver in 1 replica with multiple users

Measure latency and troughput

PLOT with 1,5 and 10 users


in each "entry" show avg latency and troughput

TEST 2 - Measure system scalability

How? 
1- run TPCC with custom driver in 1 replica with fixed users
1- run TPCC with custom driver in 2 replica with fixed users
1- run TPCC with custom driver in 5 replica with fixed users

Measure latency and troughput
